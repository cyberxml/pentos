#The grub boot loader should have password protection enabled to protect boot-time settings. To do so, select a password and then generate a hash from it by running the following command:

# grub-crypt --sha-512

#When prompted to enter a password, insert the following line into /etc/grub.conf immediately after the header comments. (Use the output from grub-crypt as the value of password-hash):

#password --encrypted password-hash

#NOTE: To meet FISMA Moderate, the bootloader password MUST differ from the root password.
